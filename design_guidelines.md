# Design Guidelines

## Issue: Image Content Not Visible

I cannot view the contents of the provided image (image_1766735869795.png), which is essential for creating accurate design guidelines for your project.

## Next Steps Required

Please provide one of the following:

1. **Description of the image**: What does it show? (e.g., a sketch, wireframe, existing design, screenshot of another app)

2. **Project details**: 
   - What type of application/website is this?
   - What are the main features or pages needed?
   - Who is the target audience?
   - Any specific design inspiration or aesthetic preferences?

3. **Re-attach the image** with a brief description of what it contains

## Once I Can See the Image

I'll provide comprehensive design guidelines including:

- **Design Approach**: Reference-based or design system selection with justification
- **Typography System**: Font families, sizes, hierarchies
- **Layout Framework**: Spacing primitives, grid systems, responsive breakpoints
- **Component Library**: Navigation, forms, cards, buttons, data displays
- **Image Strategy**: Hero images, content imagery, placement guidelines
- **Interactions**: Hover states, transitions, micro-interactions (minimal, purposeful)

**Please share the image content or project details so I can create tailored, actionable design guidelines for your project.**
